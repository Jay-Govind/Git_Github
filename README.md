## Some Key Concepts Before Diving into Git and GitHub 🚀
    -> A Version Control System helps you track the history of your code, so you can see who changed what, when, and why. It’s like a game checkpoint 🕹️: if something goes wrong, you can always return to a previous working version. In software development, version control ensures that multiple developers can work on the same project without overwriting each other's work, and easily revert to earlier versions when necessary.
